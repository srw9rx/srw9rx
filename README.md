### Sophia Walton (she/her/hers)

Hi, my name is Sophia and I am a fourth year computer science and Spanish double major at the University of Virginia. I am primarily interested in Machine Learning, specifically interpretability and natural language processing. 
Most of my schoolwork is in private repos because of the UVA honor policy, but a few of my personal final projects are available publicly on the page. Additionally, my completed research is not available to be shared because of journal application policies. However, I am happy to share my schoolwork and additional information about my research with anyone who is interested.
I hope to further document my research on machine learning bias soon.
